# Semantic Video Entity Linking - Face Recognition Pipeline


This repository contains the face recognition pipeline for the "Semantic Video Entity Linking" project. The project aims to link entities mentioned in videos to a knowledge graph, enabling semantic understanding and analysis of video content.

The original project was developed as a team effort for the ESWC 2022 conference. You can find the conference paper [here](https://2022.eswc-conferences.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pd_Grams_et_al_paper_203.pdf).  Please note that this repository only includes the part I implemented.

## Overview
The face recognition pipeline is a crucial component of the larger project, responsible for detecting and recognizing faces in videos. It utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to extract facial features and match them against a database of known faces.
